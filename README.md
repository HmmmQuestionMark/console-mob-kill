# console-mob-kill
Simple mob kill plugin with console-only commands.

## Commands
- /mobkill <type> \[world\]
  - This will kill all mobs of *<type>* in *\[world\]*.
  - <type> is the name of the entity type, \[world\] is the *optional* name of the world.
- /mobtypes
  - This will list all valid entity types.

## Misc.
This plugin is very small and very simple in its scope--there will be no new features.

If there are any issues, please report them to me in this repository's issue page.
